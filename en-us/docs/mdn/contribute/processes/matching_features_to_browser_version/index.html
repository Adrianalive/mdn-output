<p>The specific appearance of the display will vary depending on what tool you're using to view the blame information; for example, Mozilla DXR's <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/c2593a3058afdfeaac5c990e18794ee8257afe99/dom/webidl/RTCPeerConnection.webidl#l" class="external" rel=" noopener">output for the <code>RTCPeerConnection.webidl</code> file</a> looked like this when this article was written:</p>

This information can be found in one of a few different ways.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435161" class="external" rel=" noopener">bug&nbsp;1435161</a>. This bug covers implementing the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PaymentResponse/retry"><code>PaymentResponse.retry()</code></a> method. If you look at that bug, you'll see the information you need right there at the top:</p>

  <img src="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/bugzilla-fixedin-top.png" alt="Screenshot showing &quot;RESOLVED FIXED in Firefox 64&quot; at the top of the Bugzilla screen" width="487" height="104" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Right below the bug summary, you see the text "RESOLVED FIXED in Firefox 64". This corresponds to the presence of the tracking flag named <code>firefox45</code> having the value <code>fixed</code>. On older bugs, before the release-numbered tracking flags were added, you might instead find one of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A tracking flag named <code>relnote-firefox</code> with the status set to the version of Firefox the feature arrived in. This tracking flag is intended to indicate when a feature needs to be mentioned in the release notes for the browser, but serves just as well to tell us when a feature was added.

  </li>
  <li>
    The Target field in the Tracking group in Bugzilla is set to <code>mozillaN</code>, where <code>N</code> is the version number of Firefox. The trick to watch for is that this is sometimes inaccurate, as it represents when it was hoped to ship, not necessarily when it was actually released. Be sure to review the comments on the bug to ensure that it didn't miss its planned release.

This means doing a little detective work is in order. There are two approaches to take: you can try searching Bugzilla, looking for a bug that covers the change you want to identify, or you can isolate the information directly from the source tree.</p>
<h4 id="finding_a_matching_bug_in_bugzilla">Finding a matching bug in Bugzilla</h4>
<p>A good place to start: do a Bugzilla search for a bug that mentions what you're looking for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you're looking for the addition of an entire interface, try searching for the name of that interface or, failing that, the name of the API that includes the interface within the summary of the bug and whose status is <code>RESOLVED</code>. For example, if looking for information about when <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent"><code>CustomEvent</code></a> might have arrived, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14565782&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=CustomEvent&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Components&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED" class="external" rel=" noopener">this would be the search</a>. This returns a few results, the second of which is the one we're looking for: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427537" class="external" rel=" noopener">bug&nbsp;427537</a>, "Implement CustomEvent DOM3 specification". Armed with that bug number, we can go back to the <a href="#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number">previous section</a> and determine when this interface was added to Firefox.</li>
  <li>If you're looking for a property or method on an interface having been added, try searching for the interface name and the method or property name both, similar to the previous suggestion. You may find that the method was added along with the entire interface or API, so be sure to watch for the addition of the broader area too.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, just search for the API name, ideally limiting the search to bugs that are also resolved, as in the first suggestion above.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find a bug that corresponds to the feature you need compatibility information for, you can then go to <a href="#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number">Getting the Firefox release for a bug number</a> to review how to isolate that compatibility data from the bug's contents.</p>
<h4 id="finding_the_version_from_the_source_tree">Finding the version from the source tree</h4>
<p>If you don't find the information you need in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Bugzilla</a>, you can get it by tracking it down in the Firefox source tree. For the purposes of this explanation, we'll be using the <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Mozilla DXR</a> tool and the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Mozilla source tree</a> browsable on the web to locate the information.</p>
<h5 id="for_web_api_features">For web API features</h5>
<p>A web API feature change corresponds to adding, removing, or altering the signature or contents of any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An interface</li>
  <li>A method or property of an interface</li>
  <li>A constant defined by an API's specification</li>
  <li>A data type (enum, typedef, or similar)</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to identify the compatibility of a feature is to look for when the feature was added to or altered to match the compatibility point you're looking for within the <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebIDL">WebIDL</a> file that describes the corresponding interface. There are a few ways you can locate this file, depending on how the API is implemented and how old it is. From most to least likely to work, here they are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For a given interface named <code>InterfaceName</code>, go to <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/" class="external" rel=" noopener">DXR</a> and type <kbd>file:<em>InterfaceName</em>.webidl</kbd> in the search box at the top of the page and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You will probably have to then click on the name of the file in a list of files (usually only a one-file-long list).</li>
  <li>If the interface isn't found, then search for it by looking for the main interface in the API. For example, a large number of the interfaces, types, and so on for <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> are located in the file <code>RTCPeerConnection.webidl</code> in the Firefox source code, so if you don't find a WebRTC interface by its name, look in that file instead.</li>
  <li>Failing that, try looking for <kbd>file:<em>interfacename</em>.idl</kbd> to see if perhaps the interface is one which is still using the older Mozilla <a href="/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/XPIDL" class="page-not-created" title="This is a link to an unwritten page">XPIDL</a> syntax to describe it. This should not happen very often, if at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once in the WebIDL file, click the "Blame" link under "VCS Links" in the Navigation box near the top-right corner of the DXR page.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/dxr-navigation-box.png" alt="Screenshot of the DXR Navigation box" width="197" height="255" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Once in the blame view, hover the mouse cursor over the revision number at the left side of the WebIDL on the same line as (or the first revision number found immediately above) the line of WebIDL corresponding to the feature you're interested in. For example, if you're looking for when the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method <code>addTrack()</code> was added to Firefox:</p>
<p>
  <img src="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-tooltip-revision.png" alt="" width="676" height="156" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>This shows you information about the changeset; if the information shown is what you're looking for, click the <code>changeset</code> link in the tooltip popup, then see <a href="#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number">From a Mercurial changeset number</a> for details on how to get the version information you need from there.</p>
<p>If you can't find the changeset you need just by browsing the blame page, the next thing to try is to look through the revision history. Click on the <code>revisions</code> link at the top of the Mercurial blame page, or the "Log" link in the Navigation box on the DXR page. This will present a list of every changeset that altered the file you're looking at. Look for a revision that matches the feature change you're interested in; if you find a promising revision, click the <code>diff</code> link next to that revision.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-revisions-ontrack.png" alt="" width="878" height="61" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>This takes you to the changeset details page. From here, you can collect the information you need as covered in <a href="#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number">From a Mercurial changeset number</a>.</p>
<h5 id="for_html_elements">For HTML elements</h5>
<p>A good place to start is the interface that is used to implement the element. For example, to get information about changes made to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee"><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></a> element, type <kbd>file:HTMLMarqueeElement.webidl</kbd> into the DXR search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Click on the returned file name to open the WebIDL and see if you can isolate the information you require from that.</p>
<p>If the change is one that can't be determined from changes to WebIDL, you'll have to figure out where in the code the change is represented. You don't have to find all the code that implements the change. Instead, look for a line that's representative of the change. That is, a line of code that would only be present in its current form if that change has taken place. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new or changed entry in an array of property names</li>
  <li>A new or changed constant definition used only by the feature you're documenting</li>
  <li>The first line of the C++ function implementing the feature (or a function that's used only by the implementation of the feature). The existence of this line indicates the feature exists, but you can also look for changes to the parameter list.</li>
  <li>A <code>return</code> operation which changes from returning nothing or <code>undefined</code> to some new value, or changes return type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locating an appropriate line of code can be tricky, and can take some practice. It's not difficult, but it does mean learning some techniques. a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To locate source files related to an element, use the search
    <kbd>file:<em>Elementname</em></kbd>
    in DXR. This will return a list of the files related to implementing that element.
  </li>
  <li>
    To find the code that implements a given method on an element, run the search command
    <kbd>file:Elementname function:functionname</kbd>
    . For example, to locate the implementation of the <code>play()</code> method for media elements:
    <kbd>file:HTMLMediaElement function:play</kbd>

  <li>
    To locate the code implementing a property or other ID on an element, run the command file:
    <kbd>file:Elementname id:propertyname</kbd>
    . For instance, to locate the code implementing the <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> property <code>duration</code>, run the search
    <kbd>file:HTMLMediaElement id:duration</kbd>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If none of those tips for searching DXR help, click on the "Operators" button at the far right end of the search box. This will open a panel listing all the keywords you can use to perform special searches, such as <code>type:</code> to look for data types or classes in C, Python, or Rust source files.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you've found a representative line of code, the goal is to identify the Firefox changeset—and from that the Firefox version—that first introduced that line of code, or first altered that line of code to match the feature change you're documenting.</p>
<h5 id="for_css_features">For CSS features</h5>
<p>CSS changes can be a little bit tricker to nail down. The Firefox repositories don't track history of any files that record the availability of given properties, for example.</p>
<p>To determine when support for a given <strong>value</strong> for a property was added, try opening the file <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/nsCSSProps.cpp" class="external" rel=" noopener"><code>nsCSSProps.cpp</code></a> and looking through the tables of property values found there. These tables are all of type <code>KTableEntry</code>; each entry in the tables maps a CSS keyword to a value used to represent it internally. For instance, to determine when Firefox added support for the CSS Scroll Snap type value <code>proximity</code>, look through <code>nsCSSProps.cpp</code> until you find in the table <code>nsCSSProps::kScrollSnapTypeKTable</code>:</p>
<div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: cpp notranslate"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> KTableEntry nsCSSProps<span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>kScrollSnapTypeKTable<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<p>And there it is. From here, it's back to the same blame and/or revision list technique covered under <a href="#using_mercurial_blame">Using Mercurial blame</a>.</p></div><h3 id="from_a_mercurial_changeset_number"><a href="#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number" title="Permalink to From a Mercurial changeset number">From a Mercurial changeset number</a></h3><div><p>Mercurial changeset numbers are 40-digit hexadecimal numbers that can be abbreviated to any unique number of leading characters; usually you will see them presented using only the first 12 digits. You might find a changeset number in any number of places, including listed in bug comments, in Mercurial blame, log, and diff output, and so forth.</p>
<p>Each changeset describes all the changes made in a revision as well as a link to the bug it's associated with, the author of the changes, the date and time it was committed to Mercurial, and so forth. One of those places, as we've seen above, is the <code>changeset</code> link in the tooltip you get when hovering over a revision number in the Mercurial blame or diff output.</p>
<p>You can also reach a changeset's overview more directly. If you're looking at the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Mozilla Mercurial</a> web interface, you can search for the changeset number, then click through to the changeset in the search results. Or you can go to the URL <code>https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/&lt;changeset-number&gt;</code>, which takes you directly to the changeset overview.</p>
<p>For example, if I have the changeset number <code>79525105ef9a</code>, I want to visit <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/79525105ef9a" class="external" rel=" noopener">https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/79525105ef9a</a>. This brings up a page that looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-changeset.png" alt="" width="1788" height="1376" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Below this is a list of the files that changed followed by the actual diffs showing the specific changes made.</p>
<p>There is an absolute gold mine of useful information on this page, including:</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="first_release_with">first release with</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This section provides a list of the first build of Firefox that includes the change for each of the major platforms (macOS, Linux (32-bit and 64-bit), and Windows (32-bit and 64-bit). The changeset number of the last changes that went into the build, the version number of Firefox that build was part of, the Firefox build number, and a link to the complete set of source files for that release.</p>
    <p>Having the versions broken down by platform is useful because it can help you in situations where a feature is added to Windows before it reaches the Mac, or if it only applies to one platform at all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="last_release_without">last release without</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This provides the same information as "first release with," but for the build immediately prior to the one covered by "first release with."</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="releases">releases</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Provides the version numbers of Firefox that first introduced this change as well as a build number, similar to what's included in "last release without." The difference here is the "pushlog to previous" link, which provides a list of every single revision from the previous release to this one.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>At any rate, <strong>the version number next to "first release with" is the number you want</strong>, unless the change was later backed out. That's always a situation you need to be ready to handle. Make sure there aren't any comments late in the bug saying something to that effect, and keep an eye out for other bugs related to the same feature that indicate a backing-out occurred. This doesn't happen often, but it does happen.</p></div><h3 id="checking_for_platform-specific_availability"><a href="#checking_for_platform-specific_availability" title="Permalink to Checking for platform-specific availability">Checking for platform-specific availability</a></h3><div><p>Most of the time, APIs and other features are present in both the desktop and Android versions of Firefox, or in all desktop versions (Mac, WIndows, and Linux). There are exceptions, however. Here are some tips that will help you identify those exceptions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find the bug that introduces the change you're looking for, then look at the tests for that bug. See if the test for the feature is disabled by a line that looks something like one of the following:
    <div class="code-example"><pre class="brush: cpp notranslate"><code>skip<span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> toolkit <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token char">'android'</span>
skip<span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> os <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token char">'android'</span>
</code></pre></div>If either of those are present, for example, the test is disabled on Android, which means the feature is almost certainly not included on Android. Similar things can happen to disable tests on Mac or Windows.
  </li>
  <li>In general, if the files for the feature are located under <code>dom/</code> or other low-level parts of the source tree, the feature is <em>probably</em> available on both desktop and Android.</li>
  <li>If the feature involves any UI, and the implementation has files under <code>browser/</code> but not under <code>mobile/</code>, then it's pretty likely that the feature is not available on Android (and vice-versa).</li>
</ul></div><h3 id="searchfox"><a href="#searchfox" title="Permalink to Searchfox">Searchfox</a></h3><div><p>The <a href="https://searchfox.org/" class="external" rel=" noopener">Searchfox</a> web site provides another method you can use to search Firefox source code. Searchfox is a tool that indexes the Firefox repositories (most usefully, the main <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source" class="external" rel=" noopener">mozilla-central source code</a> and, interesting, the <a href="https://searchfox.org/whatwg-html/source" class="external" rel=" noopener">WHATWG HTML specification is indexed</a> as well).</p></div><h2 id="opera"><a href="#opera" title="Permalink to Opera">Opera</a></h2><div><p><em>If you have insights into locating release versions for changes to Opera, please consider helping us write this section...</em></p></div><h3 id="presto"><a href="#presto" title="Permalink to Presto">Presto</a></h3><div><p>Before Opera switched to Chromium, it used an engine developed by Opera called Presto. These resources will help you identify when features were added or removed in Presto-based versions of Opera—that is, Opera version 12.1 and earlier.</p></div><h3 id="blink_chromium_2"><a href="#blink_chromium_2" title="Permalink to Blink (Chromium)">Blink (Chromium)</a></h3><div><p>After Opera 12.10, Edge adopted the Blink engine, becoming based upon Chromium. The version number jumped to 15. The Blink engine version became Opera's version plus 13 -- that is, Opera 15 used Blink 28 (15+13=28) -- until Opera Desktop 69 and Opera Android 43. The browser files within the browser-compat-data project contain a mapping of Opera versions to Chromium/Blink versions; see <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/browsers/opera.json" class="external" rel=" noopener">browsers/opera.json</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/browsers/opera_android.json" class="external" rel=" noopener">browsers/opera_android.json</a>.</p>
<p>While most features will be the same between all Chromium browsers, there may be some exceptions. Here are some resources to help you identify those:</p></div><h2 id="safari"><a href="#safari" title="Permalink to Safari">Safari</a></h2><div><p>Fortunately, the WebKit source repository, found in SVN and available on the web using Trac, has branches for every WebKit version number, and tags for each Safari version. This makes it actually quite easy to narrow down when a given feature arrives. Find when the entry point for the feature was added, which is often in an IDL file. The WebKit version number at the time is in a <code>Source/WebCore/Configurations/Version.xcconfig</code> or <code>WebCore/Configurations/Version.xcconfig</code> file. The release branch may have already happened, so go through the branches or tags to verify that it was included.</p>
<p>You can then compare the WebKit version number to the Safari version history found on Wikipedia, if necessary, to determine exactly which Safari version was shipped with the change in place.</p></div><h3 id="useful_links"><a href="#useful_links" title="Permalink to Useful links">Useful links</a></h3><div><ul>

This means doing a little detective work is in order. There are two approaches to take: you can try searching Bugzilla, looking for a bug that covers the change you want to identify, or you can isolate the information directly from the source tree.</p>\n<h4 id=\"finding_a_matching_bug_in_bugzilla\">Finding a matching bug in Bugzilla</h4>\n<p>A good place to start: do a Bugzilla search for a bug that mentions what you're looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If you're looking for the addition of an entire interface, try searching for the name of that interface or, failing that, the name of the API that includes the interface within the summary of the bug and whose status is <code>RESOLVED</code>. For example, if looking for information about when <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent\"><code>CustomEvent</code></a> might have arrived, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14565782&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=CustomEvent&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Components&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">this would be the search</a>. This returns a few results, the second of which is the one we're looking for: <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427537\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">bug&nbsp;427537</a>, \"Implement CustomEvent DOM3 specification\". Armed with that bug number, we can go back to the <a href=\"#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number\">previous section</a> and determine when this interface was added to Firefox.</li>\n  <li>If you're looking for a property or method on an interface having been added, try searching for the interface name and the method or property name both, similar to the previous suggestion. You may find that the method was added along with the entire interface or API, so be sure to watch for the addition of the broader area too.</li>\n  <li>If all else fails, just search for the API name, ideally limiting the search to bugs that are also resolved, as in the first suggestion above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find a bug that corresponds to the feature you need compatibility information for, you can then go to <a href=\"#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number\">Getting the Firefox release for a bug number</a> to review how to isolate that compatibility data from the bug's contents.</p>\n<h4 id=\"finding_the_version_from_the_source_tree\">Finding the version from the source tree</h4>\n<p>If you don't find the information you need in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Bugzilla</a>, you can get it by tracking it down in the Firefox source tree. For the purposes of this explanation, we'll be using the <a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Mozilla DXR</a> tool and the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Mozilla source tree</a> browsable on the web to locate the information.</p>\n<h5 id=\"for_web_api_features\">For web API features</h5>\n<p>A web API feature change corresponds to adding, removing, or altering the signature or contents of any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>An interface</li>\n  <li>A method or property of an interface</li>\n  <li>A constant defined by an API's specification</li>\n  <li>A data type (enum, typedef, or similar)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to identify the compatibility of a feature is to look for when the feature was added to or altered to match the compatibility point you're looking for within the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebIDL\">WebIDL</a> file that describes the corresponding interface. There are a few ways you can locate this file, depending on how the API is implemented and how old it is. From most to least likely to work, here they are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>For a given interface named <code>InterfaceName</code>, go to <a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">DXR</a> and type <kbd>file:<em>InterfaceName</em>.webidl</kbd> in the search box at the top of the page and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You will probably have to then click on the name of the file in a list of files (usually only a one-file-long list).</li>\n  <li>If the interface isn't found, then search for it by looking for the main interface in the API. For example, a large number of the interfaces, types, and so on for <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API\">WebRTC</a> are located in the file <code>RTCPeerConnection.webidl</code> in the Firefox source code, so if you don't find a WebRTC interface by its name, look in that file instead.</li>\n  <li>Failing that, try looking for <kbd>file:<em>interfacename</em>.idl</kbd> to see if perhaps the interface is one which is still using the older Mozilla <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/XPIDL\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">XPIDL</a> syntax to describe it. This should not happen very often, if at all.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once in the WebIDL file, click the \"Blame\" link under \"VCS Links\" in the Navigation box near the top-right corner of the DXR page.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/dxr-navigation-box.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the DXR Navigation box\" width=\"197\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>Once in the blame view, hover the mouse cursor over the revision number at the left side of the WebIDL on the same line as (or the first revision number found immediately above) the line of WebIDL corresponding to the feature you're interested in. For example, if you're looking for when the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method <code>addTrack()</code> was added to Firefox:</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-tooltip-revision.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"156\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>This shows you information about the changeset; if the information shown is what you're looking for, click the <code>changeset</code> link in the tooltip popup, then see <a href=\"#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number\">From a Mercurial changeset number</a> for details on how to get the version information you need from there.</p>\n<p>If you can't find the changeset you need just by browsing the blame page, the next thing to try is to look through the revision history. Click on the <code>revisions</code> link at the top of the Mercurial blame page, or the \"Log\" link in the Navigation box on the DXR page. This will present a list of every changeset that altered the file you're looking at. Look for a revision that matches the feature change you're interested in; if you find a promising revision, click the <code>diff</code> link next to that revision.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-revisions-ontrack.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"878\" height=\"61\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>This takes you to the changeset details page. From here, you can collect the information you need as covered in <a href=\"#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number\">From a Mercurial changeset number</a>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"for_html_elements\">For HTML elements</h5>\n<p>A good place to start is the interface that is used to implement the element. For example, to get information about changes made to the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee\"><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></a> element, type <kbd>file:HTMLMarqueeElement.webidl</kbd> into the DXR search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Click on the returned file name to open the WebIDL and see if you can isolate the information you require from that.</p>\n<p>If the change is one that can't be determined from changes to WebIDL, you'll have to figure out where in the code the change is represented. You don't have to find all the code that implements the change. Instead, look for a line that's representative of the change. That is, a line of code that would only be present in its current form if that change has taken place. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A new or changed entry in an array of property names</li>\n  <li>A new or changed constant definition used only by the feature you're documenting</li>\n  <li>The first line of the C++ function implementing the feature (or a function that's used only by the implementation of the feature). The existence of this line indicates the feature exists, but you can also look for changes to the parameter list.</li>\n  <li>A <code>return</code> operation which changes from returning nothing or <code>undefined</code> to some new value, or changes return type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Locating an appropriate line of code can be tricky, and can take some practice. It's not difficult, but it does mean learning some techniques. a few suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    To locate source files related to an element, use the search\n    <kbd>file:<em>Elementname</em></kbd>\n    in DXR. This will return a list of the files related to implementing that element.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To find the code that implements a given method on an element, run the search command\n    <kbd>file:Elementname function:functionname</kbd>\n    . For example, to locate the implementation of the <code>play()</code> method for media elements:\n    <kbd>file:HTMLMediaElement function:play</kbd>\n    .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To locate the code implementing a property or other ID on an element, run the command file:\n    <kbd>file:Elementname id:propertyname</kbd>\n    . For instance, to locate the code implementing the <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> property <code>duration</code>, run the search\n    <kbd>file:HTMLMediaElement id:duration</kbd>\n    .\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect3\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If none of those tips for searching DXR help, click on the \"Operators\" button at the far right end of the search box. This will open a panel listing all the keywords you can use to perform special searches, such as <code>type:</code> to look for data types or classes in C, Python, or Rust source files.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Once you've found a representative line of code, the goal is to identify the Firefox changeset—and from that the Firefox version—that first introduced that line of code, or first altered that line of code to match the feature change you're documenting.</p>\n<h5 id=\"for_css_features\">For CSS features</h5>\n<p>CSS changes can be a little bit tricker to nail down. The Firefox repositories don't track history of any files that record the availability of given properties, for example.</p>\n<p>To determine when support for a given <strong>value</strong> for a property was added, try opening the file <a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/nsCSSProps.cpp\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><code>nsCSSProps.cpp</code></a> and looking through the tables of property values found there. These tables are all of type <code>KTableEntry</code>; each entry in the tables maps a CSS keyword to a value used to represent it internally. For instance, to determine when Firefox added support for the CSS Scroll Snap type value <code>proximity</code>, look through <code>nsCSSProps.cpp</code> until you find in the table <code>nsCSSProps::kScrollSnapTypeKTable</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: cpp notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> KTableEntry nsCSSProps<span class=\"token double-colon punctuation\">::</span>kScrollSnapTypeKTable<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> eCSSKeyword_none<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>      NS_STYLE_SCROLL_SNAP_TYPE_NONE <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> eCSSKeyword_mandatory<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> NS_STYLE_SCROLL_SNAP_TYPE_MANDATORY <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> eCSSKeyword_proximity<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> NS_STYLE_SCROLL_SNAP_TYPE_PROXIMITY <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> eCSSKeyword_UNKNOWN<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>   <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And there it is.
