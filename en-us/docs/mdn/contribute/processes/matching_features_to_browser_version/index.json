This means doing a little detective work is in order. There are two approaches to take: you can try searching Bugzilla, looking for a bug that covers the change you want to identify, or you can isolate the information directly from the source tree.</p>\n<h4 id=\"finding_a_matching_bug_in_bugzilla\">Finding a matching bug in Bugzilla</h4>\n<p>A good place to start: do a Bugzilla search for a bug that mentions what you're looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If you're looking for the addition of an entire interface, try searching for the name of that interface or, failing that, the name of the API that includes the interface within the summary of the bug and whose status is <code>RESOLVED</code>. For example, if looking for information about when <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent\"><code>CustomEvent</code></a> might have arrived, <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14565782&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=CustomEvent&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Components&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">this would be the search</a>. This returns a few results, the second of which is the one we're looking for: <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427537\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">bug&nbsp;427537</a>, \"Implement CustomEvent DOM3 specification\". Armed with that bug number, we can go back to the <a href=\"#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number\">previous section</a> and determine when this interface was added to Firefox.</li>\n  <li>If you're looking for a property or method on an interface having been added, try searching for the interface name and the method or property name both, similar to the previous suggestion. You may find that the method was added along with the entire interface or API, so be sure to watch for the addition of the broader area too.</li>\n  <li>If all else fails, just search for the API name, ideally limiting the search to bugs that are also resolved, as in the first suggestion above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find a bug that corresponds to the feature you need compatibility information for, you can then go to <a href=\"#getting_the_firefox_release_for_a_bug_number\">Getting the Firefox release for a bug number</a> to review how to isolate that compatibility data from the bug's contents.</p>\n<h4 id=\"finding_the_version_from_the_source_tree\">Finding the version from the source tree</h4>\n<p>If you don't find the information you need in <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Bugzilla</a>, you can get it by tracking it down in the Firefox source tree. For the purposes of this explanation, we'll be using the <a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Mozilla DXR</a> tool and the <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Mozilla source tree</a> browsable on the web to locate the information.</p>\n<h5 id=\"for_web_api_features\">For web API features</h5>\n<p>A web API feature change corresponds to adding, removing, or altering the signature or contents of any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>An interface</li>\n  <li>A method or property of an interface</li>\n  <li>A constant defined by an API's specification</li>\n  <li>A data type (enum, typedef, or similar)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to identify the compatibility of a feature is to look for when the feature was added to or altered to match the compatibility point you're looking for within the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebIDL\">WebIDL</a> file that describes the corresponding interface. There are a few ways you can locate this file, depending on how the API is implemented and how old it is. From most to least likely to work, here they are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>For a given interface named <code>InterfaceName</code>, go to <a href=\"https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">DXR</a> and type <kbd>file:<em>InterfaceName</em>.webidl</kbd> in the search box at the top of the page and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You will probably have to then click on the name of the file in a list of files (usually only a one-file-long list).</li>\n  <li>If the interface isn't found, then search for it by looking for the main interface in the API. For example, a large number of the interfaces, types, and so on for <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API\">WebRTC</a> are located in the file <code>RTCPeerConnection.webidl</code> in the Firefox source code, so if you don't find a WebRTC interface by its name, look in that file instead.</li>\n  <li>Failing that, try looking for <kbd>file:<em>interfacename</em>.idl</kbd> to see if perhaps the interface is one which is still using the older Mozilla <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/XPIDL\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">XPIDL</a> syntax to describe it. This should not happen very often, if at all.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once in the WebIDL file, click the \"Blame\" link under \"VCS Links\" in the Navigation box near the top-right corner of the DXR page.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/dxr-navigation-box.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the DXR Navigation box\" width=\"197\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>Once in the blame view, hover the mouse cursor over the revision number at the left side of the WebIDL on the same line as (or the first revision number found immediately above) the line of WebIDL corresponding to the feature you're interested in. For example, if you're looking for when the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method <code>addTrack()</code> was added to Firefox:</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-tooltip-revision.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"156\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>This shows you information about the changeset; if the information shown is what you're looking for, click the <code>changeset</code> link in the tooltip popup, then see <a href=\"#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number\">From a Mercurial changeset number</a> for details on how to get the version information you need from there.</p>\n<p>If you can't find the changeset you need just by browsing the blame page, the next thing to try is to look through the revision history. Click on the <code>revisions</code> link at the top of the Mercurial blame page, or the \"Log\" link in the Navigation box on the DXR page. This will present a list of every changeset that altered the file you're looking at. Look for a revision that matches the feature change you're interested in; if you find a promising revision, click the <code>diff</code> link next to that revision.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Matching_features_to_browser_version/hg-revisions-ontrack.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"878\" height=\"61\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</p>\n<p>This takes you to the changeset details page. From here, you can collect the information you need as covered in <a href=\"#from_a_mercurial_changeset_number\">From a Mercurial changeset number</a>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"for_html_elements\">For HTML elements</h5>\n<p>A good place to start is the interface that is used to implement the element. For example, to get information about changes made to the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee\"><code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code></a> element, type <kbd>file:HTMLMarqueeElement.webidl</kbd> into the DXR search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Click on the returned file name to open the WebIDL and see if you can isolate the information you require from that.</p>\n<p>If the change is one that can't be determined from changes to WebIDL, you'll have to figure out where in the code the change is represented. You don't have to find all the code that implements the change. Instead, look for a line that's representative of the change. That is, a line of code that would only be present in its current form if that change has taken place. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A new or changed entry in an array of property names</li>\n  <li>A new or changed constant definition used only by the feature you're documenting</li>\n  <li>The first line of the C++ function implementing the feature (or a function that's used only by the implementation of the feature). The existence of this line indicates the feature exists, but you can also look for changes to the parameter list.</li>\n  <li>A <code>return</code> operation which changes from returning nothing or <code>undefined</code> to some new value, or changes return type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Locating an appropriate line of code can be tricky, and can take some practice. It's not difficult, but it does mean learning some techniques. a few suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    To locate source files related to an element, use the search\n    <kbd>file:<em>Elementname</em></kbd>\n    in DXR. This will return a list of the files related to implementing that element.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To find the code that implements a given method on an element, run the search command\n    <kbd>file:Elementname function:functionname</kbd>\n    . For example, to locate the implementation of the <code>play()</code> method for media elements:\n    <kbd>file:HTMLMediaElement function:play</kbd>\n    .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    To locate the code implementing a property or other ID on an element, run the command file:\n    <kbd>file:Elementname id:propertyname</kbd>\n    .

These tables are all of type <code>KTableEntry</code>; each entry in the tables maps a CSS keyword to a value used to represent it internally.
