You might have noticed that a page is missing, or you might have seen missing content reported in our <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/issues\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">issues list</a>. For details about the CSS property you will need to find a relevant specification for it (e.g., a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">W3C specification</a>, or a bug report for a non-standard property used in rendering engines like Gecko or Blink).</p>\n<div class=\"notecard note\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using a W3C spec, always use the <strong>Editor's Draft</strong> (note the red banner on the left side) and not a published version (e.g. Working Draft). The Editor's Draft is always closer to the final version!</p>\n</div>\n<p>If the implementation and spec diverge, feel free to mention it in the implementation bug: it may be a bug in the implementation (and a follow-up bug will be filed), a delay in the publication of a new spec, or an error in the spec (in which case a spec bug is worth filing).</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"step_2_—_check_the_database_of_css_properties","title":"Step 2 — Check the database of CSS properties","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Several characteristics of a CSS property, such as its syntax or if it can be animated, are mentioned in several pages and are therefore stored in an ad-hoc database.

To do that follow this <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Live_samples\">tutorial about live samples</a>. Don't forget that we are in a document explaining one single property: you need to add examples that show how this property is working in isolation, not how the whole specification is used. That means that examples for <code>list-style-type</code> should show what the different property values generate, not how to combine it with other properties, pseudo-classes, or pseudo-elements to generate nice effects. Tutorials and guides can be written to show more.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"step_4_—_getting_a_review","title":"Step 4 — Getting a review","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Once your page is created, submit it as a PR, and a member of our review team will be assigned automatically to review your page.</p>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Step 1 — Decide which property to document","id":"step_1_—_decide_which_property_to_document"},{"text":"Step 2 — Check the database of CSS properties","id":"step_2_—_check_the_database_of_css_properties"},{"text":"Step 3 — Creating the CSS property page","id":"step_3_—_creating_the_css_property_page"},{"text":"Step 4 — Getting a review","id":"step_4_—_getting_a_review"}],"summary":"As the CSS standards evolve, new properties are always being added.
