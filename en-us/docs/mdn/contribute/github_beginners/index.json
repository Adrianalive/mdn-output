You should first make a fork of each repo you want to work on. This is required for you to submit change requests to the main version of the repo (we'll learn how to create a pull request later on). Due to security reasons, you can't submit changes directly to the main version of the repo. So to submit changes, first fork the main repo, then push the changes to your fork, and then create a pull request to get the changes from your fork merged into the main repo.</p>\n<p>Let's fork <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/mdn/content</a> right now; you'll definitely be contributing to this repo at some point. Follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    Locate the Fork button at the top-right hand corner of the content repo's page, and press it:\n    \n    <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/GitHub_beginners/fork-button.png\" alt=\"Button labeled fork, with the number 609 next to it\" width=\"134\" height=\"48\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A modal window will appear, asking you where you want to fork the repo to. Select your personal GitHub account.\n    A message will appear saying something like \"Forking mdn/content. It should only take a few seconds.\" Once GitHub has finished forking, your browser should redirect to the page for the new fork. As an example, my fork of <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/mdn/content</a> is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/content\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/content</a>.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you've forked the repo, it is time to clone your fork locally. To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Go to your fork's page on github.com (e.g. <code>https://github.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/content</code>).</li>\n  <li>\n    Press the green \"Code\" button at the top of the files list. Something similar to the following popup should appear as a result:\n    \n    <img src=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/GitHub_beginners/code-popup.png\" alt=\"Popup window showing a clone URL along with options to open with GitHub Desktop and download zip\" width=\"364\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </li>\n  <li>If you set up SSH authentication as instructed above, click the \"SSH\" tab and copy the <code>git@github.com:&lt;your-user-name&gt;/content.git</code> URL from the text field in the box. If you didn't set up SSH authentication, copy the URL from the text field on the \"HTTPS\" tab instead, which should look like this: <code>https://github.com/&lt;your-user-name&gt;/content.git</code>.</li>\n  <li>Now open up the command line on your computer, and navigate into the directory you set up earlier to store your local git repo clones in using the cd command, e.g.\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> <span class=\"token function\">git</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>Clone your fork by entering a command with the following form:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone the-url-you-copied\n</code></pre></div>So for example my cloning command looked like this:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone git@github.com:chrisdavidmills/content.git\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should now find a content directory inside your git directory, containing the contents of the repo.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"setting_up_a_remote_to_point_to_the_main_version_of_the_repo","title":"Setting up a remote to point to the main version of the repo","isH3":true,"content":"<p>One last thing to do before moving on is set up a <em>remote</em> to point to the main version of the repo, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/mdn/content</a> in the case of our example. A remote is basically a pointer to a specific remote repo location on GitHub, and is most commonly used to update your local clone so it is up-to-date with the latest main repo, as we'll see below.</p>\n<p>Setting up a remote is done with the <code>git remote add</code> command, which looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> remote-name repo-you-want-to-point-to\n</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>remote-name</em> is a name that you decide on, which is used to refer to the remote later on. It is good to stick to a consistent name for remotes across different repos that have the same purpose, so the same remote name will do the same thing everywhere, and you are less likely to get confused. So for example, the main version of the repo that you forked your version from is often called the \"upstream repo\", therefore people often use \"upstream\" as the name of the remote upstream location. I usually call my upstream remotes \"mozilla\", to signify that they point to Mozilla's main copy of the repo.</li>\n  <li><em>repo-you-want-to-point-to</em> is the SSH (or HTTPS) URL of the repo you want to point to, retrieved in the same way as we did when we were cloning our fork earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, to add your remote:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Go to the github.com page for the main version of the repo (<a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/mdn/content</a> in this example) and retrieve the SSH or HTTPS URL as appropriate, from the \"Code\" popup.</li>\n  <li>In your command line, <code>cd</code> into your content directory:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> content\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n  <li>Now run a command along the following lines, replacing <em>remote-name</em> and <em>repo-you-want-to-point-to</em> as appropriate:\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> remote-name repo-you-want-to-point-to\n</code></pre></div>So for example, I used the SSH URL and called my remote \"mozilla\":\n    <div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">git</span> remote <span class=\"token function\">add</span> mozilla git@github.com:mdn/content.git\n</code></pre></div>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your remote should now be set up.

Go to your pull request's page on github.com, go to the \"Files changed\" tab, and find the file you want to remove from the pull request. At the top right of the file's box in the page there will be a \"three dot\" (<code>...</code>) menu. Press this button and choose \"Delete file\". In the confirmation page, enter a title for the new commit, make sure the \"Commit directly...\" checkbox is selected, and press the \"Commit changes\" button.</p>\n  <p>It is usually a good idea to get the rest of the pull request looking exactly how you want it before you make changes via the GitHub UI.
