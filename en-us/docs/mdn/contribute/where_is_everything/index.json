This is where the MDN platform is stored, and where you'll go if you want to make changes to MDN's high level page structure or rendering machinery.</li>\n  <li><strong>Browser compat data</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data</a>.

Originally envisaged as a hold-all repo for general purpose MDN data, the data repo now serves the purpose of holding data about CSS features such as formal syntax, inheritance, computed value, animation type, etc. This is used to generate sections on CSS reference pages such as formal definition (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-caps#formal_definition\">example</a>) and formal syntax (<a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-caps#formal_syntax\">example</a>).</li>\n</ul>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"other_repos","title":"Other repos","isH3":false,"content":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>Demo repos</strong>.
