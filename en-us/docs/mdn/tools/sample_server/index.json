Everything else is optional. Let's take a look at this in more detail.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the_manifest_file_manifest.json\">The manifest file: manifest.json</h4>\n<p>The manifest file is used primarily to build lists of samples, but will eventually be used to help improve the startup and shutdown processes for each sample. It's a JSON object which looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: json notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"WebSocket based chat server with WebRTC video chat support\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"docsUrl\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"description\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Uses Node.js to set up a WebSocket-based chat server, and provides a web page you can use to join the chat.

This should be a relatively short title for the example.</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"docsurl\"><code>docsUrl</code></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>The URL of the primary page on MDN which discusses this example in detail. If the example is referenced from multiple pages, this should be the address of the \"main\" page (or a landing page if available).</p>\n  </dd>\n  <dt id=\"description\"><code>description</code></dt>\n  <dd>\n    <p>A longer paragraph describing the sample, including information about the technologies it demonstrates.</p>\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n<h4 id=\"running_your_sample_at_startup_startup.sh\">Running your sample at startup: startup.sh</h4>\n<p>When the sample server starts up or samples are restarted, each sample's base directory is scanned to see if there's a shell script file named <code>startup.sh</code>. If the file exists, it is executed, so that the sample has the opportunity to install support files, run any scripts, and start up any server processes that are needed to support the sample. For example, the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling\">WebSocket chat sample's</a> startup.sh script looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: bash notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> websocket\n<span class=\"token function\">node</span> chatserver.js\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The first line uses the Node package manager, <code>npm</code>, to install the module named <code>websocket</code>, which provides support for creating and/or talking to <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API\">WebSocket</a> servers.</p>\n<p>The second line actually starts up the server process, which is implemented as a JavaScript script which is started up and run in the background.</p>\n<h4 id=\"using_node.js_modules_package.json\">Using Node.js modules: package.json</h4>\n<p>To use Node modules in your project, you'll need to add a <code>package.json</code> file, which lists information about your sample but also includes a list of dependencies, so that those dependencies can be installed for you by the Node package manager (<code>npm</code>).</p>\n<h4 id=\"optional_files\">Optional files</h4>\n<p>You may of course have other files. Obvious candidates are an <code>index.html</code> file so that users that browse to your sample see some content, style sheets, support HTML and JavaScript files, images and other media, and so forth.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"submitting_your_sample","title":"Submitting your sample","isH3":true,"content":"<p>Once you've finished and tested your sample, you will want to submit it so that it can be tested and eventually installed onto the production sample server.
