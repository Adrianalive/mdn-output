This article is a \"getting started\" guide to how to add to and maintain the database from which the compatibility tables are generated, as well as how to integrate the tables into articles.</dd><dt class=\"landingPageList\" id=\"live_samples\"><a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Live_samples\">Live samples</a></dt><dd class=\"landingPageList\">MDN supports turning sample code displayed in articles into running samples the reader can look at in action. These live samples can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in any combination. Note that \"live\" samples are <em>not interactive</em>; however, they do ensure that the output displayed for a sample matches the code of the sample exactly, because it is actually generated by the code sample.</dd></dl></dl></div>\n    <div class=\"section\" id=\"sect3\"><dl><dt class=\"landingPageList\" id=\"page_types\"><a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Page_types\">Page types</a></dt><dd class=\"landingPageList\">There are a number of types of pages that are used repeatedly on MDN.\n  This article describes these page types, their purpose, and gives examples of each and templates to use when creating a new page.</dd><dt class=\"landingPageList\" id=\"quicklinks\"><a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Quicklinks\">Quicklinks</a></dt><dd class=\"landingPageList\">MDN supports adding quicklinks to pages; these are boxes containing a potentially hierarchical list of links to other pages on MDN or to pages off-site.\n  This article describes how to create quicklinks boxes.</dd><dt class=\"landingPageList\" id=\"specification_tables\"><a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Specification_tables\">Specification tables</a></dt><dd class=\"landingPageList\">Every reference page on MDN should provide information about the specification or specifications in which that API or technology was defined.
