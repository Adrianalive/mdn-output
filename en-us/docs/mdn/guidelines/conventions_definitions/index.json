versions (usually W3C versus WHATWG), e.g. one version might have a feature listed as deprecated, while the other doesn't.\n  In such cases, consider what the reality is — i.e. what browsers are actually doing — and write an \"important\" note to summarize that latest status.\n  For example, as of Jan 2019 the <a
