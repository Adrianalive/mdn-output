If the code example is not runnable or production-worthy, be sure to include a warning in a code comment and in the explanatory text — if it is a snippet and not a full example, make this clear. This also means that you should provide <strong>all</strong> of the information necessary to run the example including any dependencies and setup.</p>\n<p>Code samples should be as self-contained and easy to understand as possible. The aim is not necessarily to produce efficient, clever code that impresses experts and has great functionality, but rather to produce reduced working examples that can be understood as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Further general best practices are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The sample should be short and ideally only show the feature you are immediately interested in.</li>\n  <li><strong>Only</strong> include code that is essential for the example. A large amount of non-relevant code can easily distract or confuse the audience. If you want to provide a full, more lengthy, example put it in one of our <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">GitHub repos</a> (or a JSBin, Codepen, or similar) and then provide the link to the full version above or below the sample.</li>\n  <li>Don't include unnecessary server-side code, libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, and other such dependencies — they make the code less portable, and harder to run and understand. Use vanilla code where possible.</li>\n  <li>Don't assume knowledge of any libraries, frameworks, preprocessors, or other non-native features. For example, use class names that make sense within the example rather than classnames that make sense to BEM or Bootstrap users.</li>\n  <li>Write your code as cleanly and understandably as possible, even if it is not the most efficient way to do it.</li>\n  <li>Don't use bad practices for brevity (such as presentational elements like <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/big\"><code>&lt;big&gt;</code></a> or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write\" title=\"document.write()\"><code>document.write()</code></a>); do it correctly.</li>\n  <li>In the case of API demos, if you are using multiple APIs together point out what APIs are included, and what features come from where.</li>\n</ul>"}}],"toc":[{"text":"Article structure","id":"article_structure"},{"text":"General best practices","id":"general_best_practices"}],"summary":"This document series outlines the coding guidelines and best practices we use for writing demos, code snippets, interactive examples, etc, for use on MDN.","popularity":0.0011,"modified":"2022-03-28T14:52:22.000Z","other_translations":[{"title":"Lignes directrices pour les fragments de code","locale":"fr","native":"Français"},{"title":"Code example guidelines","locale":"ja","native":"日本語"},{"title":"Code example guidelines","locale":"ko","native":"한국어"}],"source":{"folder":"en-us/mdn/guidelines/code_guidelines","github_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/style/old/files/en-us/mdn/guidelines/code_guidelines/index.md","last_commit_url":"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/c4b6112d856dbb5fa7b929e5034499c605a51e08","filename":"index.md"},"parents":[{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN","title":"The MDN project"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines","title":"Guidelines"},{"uri":"/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines","title":"Code example guidelines"}],"pageTitle":"Code example guidelines - The MDN project | MDN","noIndexing":false}}
