A chunk can be a single byte, or it can be something larger such as a <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays\">typed array</a> of a certain size.

If you want another reader to start reading your stream, you typically need to cancel the first reader before you do anything else (although you can <strong>tee</strong> streams, see the Teeing section below)</p>\n<p>Note that there are two different types of readable stream. As well as the conventional readable stream there is a type called a byte stream — this is an extended version of a conventional stream for reading underlying byte sources. Compared with the conventional readable stream, byte streams are allowed to be read by BYOB readers (BYOB, \"bring your own buffer\"). This kind of reader allows streams to be read straight into a buffer supplied by the developer, minimizing the copying required. Which underlying stream (and by extension, reader and controller) your code will use depends on how the stream was created in the first place (see the <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/ReadableStream\" title=\"ReadableStream()\"><code>ReadableStream()</code></a> constructor page).</p>\n<div class=\"notecard warning\" id=\"sect1\">\n  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Byte streams are not implemented anywhere as yet, and questions have been raised as to whether the spec details are in a finished enough state for them to be implemented.

Effectively the same stream is written to, and then the same values are read. A simple example is a text decoder, where raw bytes are written, and then strings are read.
