Even if an element is in the middle of a transition, the new transition starts from the current style immediately instead of jumping to the end CSS state.

CSS animations consist of two components: a style describing the CSS animation, and a set of key frames that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate points.
