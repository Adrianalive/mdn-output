You can get accessibility report for errors, warnings. You can view the structure and order view of the document. You can see a text-only view and outline view of the document.\n    You can install a custom WAVE toolbar in Firefox for a quick, easy and convenient evaluation of web pages directly within Firefox.

It's free. It <strong>works off-line</strong> and that is a major advantage over other accessibility checkers. No document upload needed and no additional application to launch; everything is accessible within the Firefox browser.\n    This HTML advanced validator Firefox extension is very resourceful and highly customizable. It's an extension add-on to Firefox 2.x and Firefox 3.x. It not only checks and reports possible markup errors and warnings (based on W3C Tidy and/or based on true SGML validation) but it can also report accessibility errors and warnings according to selectable accessibility guidelines (Section 508, WCAG Priorities 1, 2 or 3). Its accessibility report is viewable in the View Source window (View &gt; Source code <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd> or right-click on the status bar). Two panes are added at the bottom of the view source code window: the left pane contains the errors and warnings (with their correspondent line number) and the right pane identifies the checkpoint along with an example and a clickable link to the reference/guideline. <strong>Just wonderful!</strong>\n    The HTML advanced validator may also be downloaded from <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/249\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Firefox Add-ons: HTML Validator</a>.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://juicystudio.com/services/colourcontrast.php#contrast\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Color contrast analyzer</a>\n    by Juicy Studio\n    How can a web author establish easily and quickly if the background color and foreground (text) color in use in his webpages have sufficient color contrast difference and sufficient color brightness difference? <a href=\"https://juicystudio.com/services/colourcontrast.php#contrast\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Color contrast analyzer</a> is an excellent tool for such task.
