This wasn't an attractive thing for your users to see, and could also result in performance issues due to the repainting required after each image loads, hence adding the attributes being a good idea.</p>\n<p>Let's move forward a few years to the era of responsive design. To keep images from breaking out of their containers when the container becomes narrower than the image, developers started using CSS like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example\"><pre class=\"brush: css notranslate\"><code><span class=\"token selector\">img</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">max-width</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 100%<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">height</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> auto<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is really useful for responsive layouts, but unfortunately it causes the jank problem to return — the above CSS overrides the width and height attribute information, meaning that if the image has not loaded for some reason, its height will be set to 0. When the image finally loads, the same jank will occur as the page layout is shifted to make space for it.</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"a_new_way_of_sizing_images_before_loading_completes","title":"A new way of sizing images before loading completes","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Recognizing the problem, a WICG community group formed to propose an <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/intrinsicsize-attribute\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\"><code>intrinsicsize</code></a> attribute. Folks from Mozilla then expanded on this thinking, working on a proposal in the CSS <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Box Sizing Level 4</a> draft to define an <code>aspect-ratio</code> property and propose the idea of using the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes to compute layout.
