Whatever you want to do is fine, as long as it works for you. You will be assigned a member of MDN staff to provide guidance on the MDN Web Docs side of things, and advice and help in general.</p>\n<p>You should assign one (or two) team leads, to act as a central point of contact for the MDN team member, and anyone else wishing to contact the team about it (you might get more offers of help, for example).</p>\n<p>Once your team is assembled, you'll need to get them all to <a href=\"/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account\" class=\"page-not-created\" title=\"This is a link to an unwritten page\">create MDN accounts</a>, and then talk to your MDN rep to work out what site permissions each person needs (e.g. creating pages, moving pages, etc.)</p>"}},{"type":"prose","value":{"id":"project_planroadmap","title":"Project plan/roadmap","isH3":false,"content":"<p>Write down a plan for the work — what needs to be done, and when?

If the project is large, you should consider getting one of your team members to be a project manager for the project, and using a project tracking tool like <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" class=\"external\" rel=\" noopener\">Trello</a>.

Feel free to keep a record of these, and even host them on a page inside your own project pages.</p>\n<p>In terms of standards, you are expected to maintain a reasonable level of quality for your documentation to stay on MDN. Your MDN rep will work with you on this to make you clear on what is expected.
