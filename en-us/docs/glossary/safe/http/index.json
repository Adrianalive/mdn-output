In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET\"><code>GET</code></a>, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD\"><code>HEAD</code></a>, or <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS\"><code>OPTIONS</code></a>.

For example, <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT\"><code>PUT</code></a> and <a href=\"/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE\"><code>DELETE</code></a> are both idempotent but unsafe.</p>\n<p>Even if safe methods have a read-only semantic, servers can alter their state: e.g. they can log or keep statistics. What is important here is that by calling a safe method, the client doesn't request any server change itself, and therefore won't create an unnecessary load or burden for the server. Browsers can call safe methods without fearing to cause any harm to the server; this allows them to perform activities like pre-fetching without risk. Web crawlers also rely on calling safe methods.</p>\n<p>Safe methods don't need to serve static files only; a server can generate an answer to a safe method on-the-fly, as long as the generating script guarantees safety: it should not trigger external effects, like triggering an order in an e-commerce Web site.</p>\n<p>It is the responsibility of the application on the server to implement the safe semantic correctly, the webserver itself, being Apache, Nginx or IIS, can't enforce it by itself.
